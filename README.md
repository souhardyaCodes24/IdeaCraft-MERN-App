while installing git here my default is different thanthe one in tutoriral so what shuldi do

ChatGPT said:
The screen you’re on is asking which SSL/TLS library Git should use for HTTPS connections:

Your Options:
OpenSSL library

Uses its own certificate bundle (ca-bundle.crt).

Slightly more consistent across platforms (Linux/macOS).

Native Windows Secure Channel library (this is selected by default in your case)

Uses Windows' built-in certificate store.

Better integration with corporate environments (e.g., company-wide internal certificates via Active Directory).

What Should You Choose?
✔️ If you're a regular Windows user and not behind a corporate firewall, the default option (Windows Secure Channel) is perfectly fine — you can safely click "Next".

❗ If your tutorial selected OpenSSL, it's likely just a preference, not a requirement. Git will work the same way in most personal use cases with either.

👉 So unless the tutorial specifically mentions that OpenSSL is required for a later step, you're safe sticking with the default.

Let me know if you'd like me to cross-check anything else from your setup!

ChatGPT said:
Of course! I'd be happy to help with your GitHub project. Just let me know:

What kind of project it is (e.g., web app, Python script, C++ project)?

What you need help with specifically (e.g., cloning, pushing code, resolving errors, setting up GitHub Pages)?

Whether you're using GitHub Desktop, Git command line, or Git integration in an IDE (like VS Code)?

Feel free to upload any screenshots or error messages if needed too!
